      <p1><b>Climate</b></p1>
      <p1>Global temperatures are rising at unprecedented levels. Since 1880, global temperatures have risen by more than 1˚C (1.8˚F), while levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have increased from 280 parts per million (ppm) to more than 400ppm. Atmospheric and oceanic temperatures have steadily climbed, and the impacts of this warming are clear. Glaciers are receding or disappearing and Arctic sea ice is declining. Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are melting and sea levels are rising. Scientists have determined that it is extremely likely the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from human activity is the largest driver of this change.</p1>
